Node js Module:
Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused
throughout the Node.js application. Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or
pollute global scope.Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.Node.js implements CommonJS 
modules standard.
Node.js includes three types of modules:
-Core Modules
-Local Modules
-Third Party Modules
Core Modules:
Node.js is a light weight framework. The core modules include bare minimum functionalities of Node.js. These core modules are compiled
into its binary distribution and load automatically when Node.js process starts. However, you need to import the core module first in 
order to use it in your application.
1.http:The HTTP module provides a way of making Node.js transfer data over HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).
2.url:The URL module provides a way of parsing the URL string.
3.querystring:The Query String module provides a way of parsing the URL query string.
4.path:The Path module provides a way of working with directories and file paths.
5.fs:The File System module provides a way of working with the computer's file system.
6.util:The Util module provides access to some utility functions.
7.zlib:The Zlib module provides a way of zip and unzip files
8.https:The HTTPS module provides a way of making Node.js transfer data over HTTP TLS/SSL protocol, which is the secure HTTP protocol.
9.dns:The DNS module provides a way of performing name resolutions.

Local Modules:
Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application. These modules include different functionalities of your application
in separate files and folders. You can also package it and distribute it via NPM, so that Node.js community can use it. For example,
if you need to connect to MongoDB and fetch data then you can create a module for it, which can be reused in your application.
Exports is used to create local modules.
Example:
var log = {
           //code 
           }
    };
module.exports = log

Third Party Modules:
Third party modules are the modules created by an organisation and upload to npm.
Example:
Express,React,Node Mysql
