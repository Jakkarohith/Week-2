Defination of Callback hell:
Callback hell is the eventual state of any complex callback oriented asynchronous program
where the management of callbacks gets so hard that the performance benefits of callbacks notwithstanding,
your code becomes extremely hard to understand, reason about and maintain.

In simple terms,The situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks several level dee,
making the code difficult to understand and maintain.

Example:
function hellcallback() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('This is the first function');
      setTimeout(function() {
        console.log('This is the second function');
          setTimeout(function() {
           console.log('This is the third function');
              setTimeout(function() {
              console.log('This is the fourth function');
              setTimeout(function() {
                console.log('This is the fifth function');
                setTimeout(function() {
                    console.log('This is the sixth function');
                    setTimeout(function() {
                        console.log('This is the seventh function'); 
          }, 5000);
        }, 4000);
      }, 3000);
    }, 2000);
   }, 2000);
 }, 2000);
}, 2000);
  };
hellcallback();

Disadvantages:
1.Increase in the number of callbacks would make code less readable.
2.Increase in number of callback will flood the event loop which will effect the performance.
